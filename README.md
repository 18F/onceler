# Onceler

The Onceler listens to your secrets and shares them exactly once.

    You won't see the Once-ler.
    Don't knock at his door.
    He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store.
    He lurks in his Lerkim, cold under the roof,
    where he makes his own clothes
    out of miff-muffered moof.
    And on special dank midnights in August,
    he peeks
    out of the shutters
    and sometimes he speaks
    and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.

            He'll tell you, perhaps....
            if you're willing to pay.
